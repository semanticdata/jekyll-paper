# Prose Poetry

"Prose Poetry" holds the source code for my old Blog in Spanish. All articles contained herein were written in the first half of 2010. The canonical source can be found [here](https://elandres.wordpress.com/).

> Prose poetry is poetry written in prose form instead of verse form, while preserving poetic qualities such as heightened imagery, parataxis, and emotional effects.
