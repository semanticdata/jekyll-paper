# Prose Poetry

>Prose poetry is poetry written in prose form instead of verse form, while preserving poetic qualities such as heightened imagery, parataxis, and emotional effects.

Prose Poetry holds the source code for my old Blog in Spanish. All articles contained herein were written in the first half of 2010. It is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and themed with [Jekyll-Paper](https://github.com/ghosind/Jekyll-Paper).
