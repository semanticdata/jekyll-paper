# Prose Poetry

>Prose poetry is poetry written in prose form instead of verse form, while preserving poetic qualities such as heightened imagery, parataxis, and emotional effects.

Prose Poetry holds the code for my old Blog in Spanish, themed with [Jekyll-Paper](https://github.com/ghosind/Jekyll-Paper).
